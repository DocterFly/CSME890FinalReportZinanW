# CSME890FinalReportZinanW

# This repo inlcudes one final report for the class CSME890, two python scripts in format of Jupyter Notebook (ipynb), two feature table in format of txt and one fasta file for extracting protein coding sequences. 

# The build_db.ipynb was used to generate the feature table; the define_class.ipynb can be used as a sequence parser to locate   input gene and flanking genes at the upstream and downstream of the input gene, as well as to extract protein coding           sequences.

# This is an ongoing project. Will update once I have finished further steps.
